portsman - ports manager is an ncurses based graphical front-end to manage
the FreeBSD ports collection more efficient as by command line.

There're two man pages portsman(1) and portsmanrc(5). Also have a look into
the online help of portsman, which describes shortly (like a howto) each
function of portsman.

To compile and install portsman just type:
   ./configure
   make install clean
   
under FreeBSD.

If you want to contribute portsman, please let me know.
Visit http://portsman.berlios.de for further details.
