FAQ of portsman
===============

Q: Why does portsman uses ncurses instead of xlib, qt, gtk or wings?
A: Think of servers without x.
Q: Why does the meta-category "All ports" shows more installed ports,
   than the status bar?
A: Well, this is a little bit confusing, but the number of ports installed
   in the statusbar equals to that one in /var/db/pkg (or its equivalent).
   The number of ports installed in the right column of categories counts
   also all older or newer ports - which are or aren't installed. This
   means each port with a "<" (older) or ">" (newer) mark. This feature
   supports you in detecting new or old versions of ports.
   Why does this matter? Well, all port names which aren't installed but marked
   as older or newer are equal until the last "-". So the algorithm marks
   them as installed. If you're not sure, which ports are currently installed,
   look into "only installed ports" browsing mode.
